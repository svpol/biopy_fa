There are 2 modules in this package:
1. mat_fa - allows to perform matrix processes with nucleotide sequences.
2. desc_fa - allows to search records having a particular string in their descriptions.

The functions are designed to work with fasta or fastq files. Other formats applicable to Biopython are not forbidden explicitly, but once the user chooses any different format, the functions' behaviour may be unpredicted.

There are 3 files to test the functionality, each in its own directory: Sample_1, Sample_2, Sample_3.
